# TypingTest
Hello! This is a words-per-minute game that I worked on in the Spring Semester of 2022. This project was more difficult than I expected it to be. Throughout the course of this project, I learned about:
- How to combine JavaScript and HTML/CSS to make a reactive website
- How if you stop and think, there is sometimes a much simpler solution to a problem that seems complex
- How to design applications that are more intuitive to the user
